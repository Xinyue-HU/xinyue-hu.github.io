## Development Projects
### MiniCAML (a DIY Programming Language)
Implemented a programming language called MiniCAML in OCaml. Available functionalities such as free variables, substitution, evaluation, type checking, and type inference. MiniCAML has been extended to n-ary function abstraction, application, and recursion.

### Implement RDP in GINI Router & GINI Router as a VNF
GINI is an open-source toolkit developed by McGill University for creating virtual network topology. We used S&W algorithm to realize the reliable data transfer on top of UDP in GINI. We also did an investigation on GINI router forwarding path based on the existing document and code to improve GINI router performance in terms of packet processing rate, QoS, vertically scaling and horizontal scaling.

### Interactive 3D Games Development
We developed two 3D games using Threejs. 1. A car drives on a rotating planet, and the main goal is to avoid hitting trees, which are randomly generated on the planet. 2. A helicopter can move in the 3D space freely. We used the Perlin noise to randomly create the topography (infinite and never repeat), including trees, mountains, rivers and clouds. We used Gerstner wave function to simulate water fluctuations. Energy decreases with flight time, and the aviator needs to search for randomly generated energy balls to keep the helicopter flying. We added seasonal effects and music to both games.

### Smart Locker Controlling System
We designed and implemented a multi-threads message passing framework, and divided the real-world smart locker into four parts: octopus card reader, barcode reader, server, touch screen and locker. All subsystems communicate with each other through the central controller purely by message passing. We adopted MVC design pattern: each subsystem has a hardware emulator, a driver, a controller and a display.

### Secure Email Communication System
An interactive email application achieves secure communication through symmetric encryption, digital signature and authentication. The program allows multiple users and attackers to join.

### Shooting Game Using Processing IDE
Processing is a graphical library and IDE built for the art and visual design. I referred to the game ”The Binding of Isaac” and developed a Chinoiserie shooting game using Processing. During each game phase, the enemy would move in a semi-random way and periodically shoot bullets towards the player, the player need to dodge attack and take down the enemy along the way.
